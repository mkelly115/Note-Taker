The purpose of this project was to modify the code given to us to allow the javascript on the front end to interact with a database that will allow a user to save a note (with a title and body), recall that saved note, and as a bonus delete a given note. This will all be put together and then deployed using Heroku to allow the web page to be live and use the code to store the users input and chosen saves.

## Usage

When the user enters the webpage they will click a button that says "Get Started" This will direct them to a second page which will only accept the users input once both the body and title have been filled. This will use the students routing to send the users data to an API db that will save the users input. The User will also have the ability to click on the title of an old note, and the API will recall both the title and body. As for the bonus section, I used a unique ID npm that allows each user input to be assigned a unique ID that can be used on the back end to delete the appropriately selected comment.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I found the actual code portion of this project to be fairly intuitive. I struggled heavily with the file paths and routes. Most of my code was sound once the parts connected. I just spent almost a week attempting to debug the connection and with the help of teachers and some research I was able to finish things up. I think overall I learned how to debug in a more efficient fashion. I have begun to break down individual pieces and when using it in unison with the chrome debug I believe I have become more confident in my ability to diagnose the problem.
